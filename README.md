This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to implicit type conversion during comparisons.  The `f` function compares two numeric arguments; however, if these arguments were inadvertently passed as strings or if there's a type mismatch in the arguments passed, the comparison may yield unexpected results due to VBScript's loose type system. The solution provides a more robust comparison method.
